# Density Deconvolution with Normalizing Flows

This repository contains code for the experiments in our Density Deconvolution with Normalizing Flows paper.

## Setup

The `deconv` package can be installed using `pip install .`, or with `pip install -e .` if you wish to modify it.

For now you will need to use [our fork](https://github.com/JamesRitchie/nflows) of the `nflows` package until we can merge our changes upstream.

## Experiments

Experiments used in the paper are available under [experiments/flows](experiments/flows).
