  abstract = {We generalize the well-known mixtures of Gaussians approach to density estimation and the accompanying Expectation\textendash{}Maximization technique for finding the maximum likelihood parameters of the mixture to the case where each data point carries an individual d-dimensional uncertainty covariance and has unique missing data properties. This algorithm reconstructs the error-deconvolved or ``underlying'' distribution function common to all samples, even when the individual data points are samples from different distributions, obtained by convolving the underlying distribution with the heteroskedastic uncertainty distribution of the data point and projecting out the missing data directions. We show how this basic algorithm can be extended with conjugate priors on all of the model parameters and a ``split-and-merge'' procedure designed to avoid local maxima of the likelihood. We demonstrate the full method by applying it to the problem of inferring the three-dimensional velocity distribution of stars near the Sun from noisy two-dimensional, transverse velocity measurements from the Hipparcos satellite.},

  abstract = {With the advent of big data, we see an increasing interest in computing correlations in huge data sets with both many instances and many variables. Essential descriptive statistics such as the variance, standard deviation, covariance, and correlation can suffer from a numerical instability known as "catastrophic cancellation" that can lead to problems when naively computing these statistics with a popular textbook equation. While this instability has been discussed in the literature already 50 years ago, we found that even today, some high-profile tools still employ the instable version. In this paper, we study a popular incremental technique originally proposed by Welford, which we extend to weighted covariance and correlation. We also discuss strategies for further improving numerical precision, how to compute such statistics online on a data stream, with exponential aging, with missing data, and a batch parallelization for both high performance and numerical precision. We demonstrate when the numerical instability arises, and the performance of different approaches under these conditions. We showcase applications from the classic computation of variance as well as advanced applications such as stock market analysis with exponentially weighted moving models and Gaussian mixture modeling for cluster analysis that all benefit from this approach.},

  volume = {156},
  issn = {1538-3881},
  abstract = {Converting a noisy parallax measurement into a posterior belief over distance requires inference with a prior. Usually, this prior represents beliefs about the stellar density distribution of the Milky Way. However, multiband photometry exists for a large fraction of the Gaia-TGAS Catalog and is incredibly informative about stellar distances. Here, we use 2MASS colors for 1.4 million TGAS stars to build a noise-deconvolved empirical prior distribution for stars in color\textendash{}magnitude space. This model contains no knowledge of stellar astrophysics or the Milky Way but is precise because it accurately generates a large number of noisy parallax measurements under an assumption of stationarity; that is, it is capable of combining the information from many stars. We use the Extreme Deconvolution (XD) algorithm\textemdash{}which is an empirical-Bayes approximation to a full-hierarchical model of the true parallax and photometry of every star\textemdash{}to construct this prior. The prior is combined with a TGAS likelihood to infer a precise photometric-parallax estimate and uncertainty (and full posterior) for every star. Our parallax estimates are more precise than the TGAS catalog entries by a median factor of 1.2 (14\% are more precise by a factor {$>$}2) and they are more precise than the previous Bayesian distance estimates that use spatial priors. We validate our parallax inferences using members of the Milky Way star cluster M67, which is not visible as a cluster in the TGAS parallax estimates but appears as a cluster in our posterior parallax estimates. Our results, including a parallax posterior probability distribution function for each of 1.4 million TGAS stars, are available in companion electronic tables.},

  volume = {595},
  abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page. \href{http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia}{http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia}},

  abstract = {Summary. We propose a generic on-line (also sometimes called adaptive or recursive) version of the expectation\textendash{}maximization (EM) algorithm applicable to latent variable models of independent observations. Compared with the algorithm of Titterington, this approach is more directly connected to the usual EM algorithm and does not rely on integration with respect to the complete-data distribution. The resulting algorithm is usually simpler and is shown to achieve convergence to the stationary points of the Kullback\textendash{}Leibler divergence between the marginal distribution of the observation and the model distribution at the optimal rate, i.e. that of the maximum likelihood estimator. In addition, the approach proposed is also suitable for conditional (or regression) models, as illustrated in the case of the mixture of linear regressions model.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Recommendations are made on the responsible use of \emph{Gaia\emph{ DR2 results.\emph{Methods.\emph{ The raw data collected with the \emph{Gaia\emph{ instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the \emph{Gaia\emph{ Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to \emph{Gaia\emph{ DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products. \emph{Results. Gaia\emph{ DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in \emph{G\emph{ for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars.
